                    <br><strong>Steve Hamilton</strong>- Composer, 6 String Electric Bass, Acoustic Bass, Percussion
                    <br><strong>Greg de Denus</strong>- Piano, Keyboards

                    <br>Recorded June 2000
                    <br><br>An Evenings Journey into Night” is the first album release from Canadian Jazz bassist Steve Hamilton. After 35 years on the scene playing jazz, classical, new music, theatre and working with singer songwriters. We are finally able to see his own creative output.
                   The evocative album title gives an indication of what lies within on this album.
                   <br><br>Hamilton draws on his varied experiences with jazz, classical and world music, creating music that is  organically fused, defying description and categorization. This music has cinematic, journey like quality that captures your attention from the first notes, melodically strong, at times hypnotic.       
                   <br><br>“This music is really a snap shot of what is meaningful to me as an artist. Strong melodic writing comes first. I wanted to create music that cinematically and emotionally draws the listener in.
                   Even though there is a lot of variety on this recording, there is a still an artistic thread that connects the arc of the album as a whole. My influences cover the whole history of Jazz, the Western classical tradition and other musics from across the globe.  It is a big deal to me is to organically meld these influences in a personal, creative and seamless way”.
                   <br><br>Hamilton splits his time between acoustic bass, (many times playing bowed parts that give the music a orchestral element.) and his 6 string bass made by master luthier Linda Manzer. The instrument is a semi acoustic instrument turned like a guitar and octave down. At times it is hard to tell what this instrument is due to its unique sound. This instrument plays a major role throughout the album, where it takes centre stage in pieces like An Evening Journey into Night, Point of Departure, As We Speak, Like an Arrow and Nocturne.
